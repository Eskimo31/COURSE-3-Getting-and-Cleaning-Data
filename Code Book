Raw data collection
-------------------

### Collecting the Data

Raw data  was gathered from Machine Learning repository. The data set that was used was 
the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

An experiment was conducted with a group of volunteers, doing  six activities
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). Each person wore a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist, this allows for the gathering of information.



Project Details
-------------------

The raw data sets are processed with run_analisys.R script to create a tidy data
set

### Merge training and test sets

Test and training data  are merged to obtain a single data set (data.one).
Variables are labelled with the names assigned by original
collectors (features.txt).

### Extract mean and standard deviation variables

From the merged data set  I extracted data  with only the
values of estimated mean (variables with labels that contain "mean") and standard
deviation (variables with labels that contain "std").

### Use descriptive activity names

A new column is added with the activity description.
Activity id column is used to look up descriptions in activity_labels.txt.

### Label variables appropriately

Labels given from the original collectors were changed:
* to obtain valid R names without parentheses, dashes and commas
* to obtain more descriptive labels

### Create a tidy data set

From the data set is created a final tidy data set .

The tidy data set contains observations with variables divided in:

*  an activity label : WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
